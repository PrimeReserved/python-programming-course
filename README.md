#### Day 1: Introduction to Python

1. **What is Python?**

#### Overview of Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

**History and Evolution:**

Created by ***Guido van Rossum*** and first released in 1991.
Named after the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus."
Python has evolved through various versions, with Python 3 being the most widely used.

**Key Features:**

- Simple syntax and easy to learn.
- Extensive standard library and active community support.
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more.

2. **Installing Python and Setting Up the Environment**

**Installing Python:**

Download and install Python from the official website [python.org](www.python.org).
Verify installation by running python --version in the terminal.

**Setting Up Anaconda:**

Why Anaconda?

Anaconda is a distribution that includes Python and many useful libraries for data science, machine learning, and more.
It simplifies package management and deployment.

**Installation Steps:**

- Download Anaconda from anaconda.com.
- Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
- Open the Anaconda Navigator to manage environments and launch tools like Jupyter Notebook.

**Setting Up VSCode:**

- Why VSCode?
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight and powerful code editor with excellent Python support.

**Installation Steps:**

- Download VSCode from code.visualstudio.com.
- Install the Python extension for VSCode.
- Configure VSCode to use the Python interpreter.
- Running Python in VSCode:
- Open a new Python file and write a simple script.
- Run the script using the integrated terminal or the play button.
